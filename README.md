TwitchKeys is a Chrome Extension that allows you to add hot keys for quick emote use in Twitch chat.

Once installed, you can head over to Twitch and use the TwitchKeys extension button below chat to set your emote per hot key.

To use a hot key, focus the chat textbox and hold ```Ctrl + Key Number``` for whichever number key you set. The emote text you saved should now appear in the textbox.
